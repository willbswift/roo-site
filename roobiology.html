these reasons, each&nbsp;house has one of Rassilon's Genetic Loom
Breeding-Engines (with a unique genetic core) to loom its cousins.</span><span class="A-audiobook"> Every Gallifreyan is born into one of Rassilon’s Great Houses and the Honorable Central Population Directory defines
					the quota of cousins for each House's Loom. </span>
				<span class="A-game">This directory is directly controlled by the High Council,&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">and
violations of the quota are reported to the Cardinal Prime of that
Houses Chapter. Records of each looming are stored in Bureau of
Loomographic Records and, in the pre-Time War era, there are between 3
and 9 million Gallifreyans living on the planet.&nbsp; </span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-audiobook">A Loom of Rassilon consists of <span class="A-notbbc">a gene-weaving frame with</span> millions of fine cords which weave </span><span class="A-notbbc">matter (probably rapid growth biomass) and biodata together <span class="A-audiobook">in a vat of semiotic fluid. Some Loom's are horizontal coffin shaped tanks <span class="A-licensed">and others are vertical cylinders.</span> &nbsp;<span class="A-tv">The subject begins as an egg with the consistency of jelly. </span></span>They
smell of tangy celestial potental. The frames of some looms are silver.
A new loom probably takes over 11 years to produce its first loomling. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Looms are held in the loomshed of the&nbsp;physical house. Each House's loom has its own genetic Loom core, which serves as
					its genius loci.<span class="A-notbbc"> Using its biodata extractor,</span> this core creates a template that standardizes the abilities

				<span class="A-notbbc">Members of each house have minor variations in abilities unique to their house. </span>

					<span class="A-audiobook">A loom automatically record the genetic metamorphosis every time one of its cousins regenerates. </span>
