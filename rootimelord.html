				<span class="A-licensed">from the Eye of Harmony. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">This alters the Initiate's DNA, creating the symbiotic nucleotides, a fourth helix of DNA, and the other </span>

people to operate and should only be used when the TARDIS has been
completely powered down. <span class="A-game">The severing of this link would cause a massive shock to the body of a Time Lord, weakening them greatly and disabling

				<span class="A-audiobook"><br><br>A side effect of the full link is that a Time Lord is constantly sending small temporal waves throughout the Universe

					<h2>Time Lord Senses</h2>
					<div class="section">
						<span class="A-audiobook">In all Time Lords have 27 different senses and all but the first five are related to time. Despite these senses a Time
							Lord's understanding of the 4th dimension is mathematical and not instinctual.
							<span class="A-game">While many of these senses are enabled through the Rassilon Imprimatur they share with their TARDIS,</span> it is
							their Time Brain that processes many (if not all) of these time senses.&nbsp;<span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv">The temporal lobe on humans handles auditory input,</span> so it’s likely that Time Lords process much of their temporal senses as sounds.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-tv">These senses grow more acute the more times a Time Lord crosses the Time-Fields </span>
						<span class="A-fanon">in a TARDIS&nbsp;<span class="A-audiobook">(because
their artron levels are boosted with each trip). A Time Lord grows
quite dependent on these senses and to be cut off from them (perhaps by
finding one's self in a universe without Time) would cause
psychological reactions akin to losing a limb. </span>
						</span>
						<span class="A-audiobook">
							<span class="A-audiobook">The following is a list of known Time Lord senses:</span>
						</span>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<span class="A-tv">Sight </span>

						<li>
							<span class="A-tv">Hearing </span>

							<span class="A-tv">Taste </span>
						</li>

							<span class="A-tv">Smell. Time Lord noses might have 'special powers,' </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">including the ability to taste the adrenochrome in a panicked human's body from several feet away.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-tv">Touch, Temperature, and Pain</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-tv">Acceleration and Balance: </span>
							<span class="A-tv">Gravity and acceleration dilate the passage of time. </span>
							<span class="A-tv">Gallifreyans gravity senses are keen enough that (with the help of yo-yo
								<span class="A-audiobook">or jumping up and down a bit),</span> they can also tell when a gravitational field is artificial. </span>
							<span class="A-tv">A Gallifreyan can sense the rotation of the planet he's standing on. </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">With some effort they can even detect the approximate mass of a planet they are currently orbiting.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-tv">Sense of Time: the basic awareness that time is passing which most lesser species have. </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Traveling backwards in time without shielding can make them dizzy but their</span><span class="A-audiobook"></span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;emergency 'backwards' consciousness&nbsp;alows them to continue to think and perceive even in this state. </span><span class="A-audiobook">Some Time Lords have Internal Chronometry abilities,
								which allow them to know the time down to a nanosecond (the Doctor can’t do this). <span class="A-fanon">Humans
have 3 dimensional vestibular sense (with canal loops extending in
three directions). Do Time Lords have 4 dimensional vestibular sense
(with a canal loop extending into the 4th dimension of Time)? </span></span>
						</li>
						<li>

								its not too low to detect)</span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-fanon">. </span>As time sensitives, they can see a mist of slithery bockatrons hanging around other time travelers.</span><span class="A-game"> </span><span class="A-tv">They can read the last few moments of life from the artron imprint on a recently dead skull. </span><span class="A-audiobook">Residul
psionic energy makes a Gallifreyan’s teeth itch. The older the energy,
the stronger the itch. Some Time Lords have greater psionic sensitivity
then others. Every Gallifreyan has a unique psycho-kinetic signature.
This allows</span><span class="A-tv"> them to recognize each other even if they are wearing a new body. </span><span class="A-audiobook">Their
telepathic intuition allows them to determine which people are
Gallifreyans and which are not. They are also able to tell if humans
are telepathic or not. For more information see </span><a href="roobiology.html#psionics">Psionics</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">Magnetoception: </span>
							<span class="A-tv">Strong magnetic fields give their skin goosebumps. Magnetic fields also cause fluctuations in artron energy. </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Use of a transmat leaves a Time Lords fingers tingling for about an hour afterwards. </span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Topographical
Sense: A Time Lord can tell when they are inside a micro-universe by
looking for a slight warping on the edge of his field of vision. To a
Time Lord, the air in other universes (like the Land of Fiction) tasts
like boiled cabbage and wet dog.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-tv">Some Time Lords can measure rooms down to the centimeter by eye sight alone.</span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">This Topographical Sense also allows them to remember any path they have taken
								<span class="A-fanon">(this might work by tracing their own biodata).</span> To use their Topographical Sense in this way they must however remember
								to store the path they took.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">Time Lords feel a sickening plunging sensation in their abdomen when they pass through a temporal lock.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Higher
Dimensions: Like all life forms that reside in the first 5 dimensions
Time Lords are normally incapable of observing the 6-11th dimensions.
However, an organ in a Time Lord's hypothalamus allows them to perceive
higher dimensions by reciting the right equations.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-notbbc">Time-Smell: </span>
							<span class="A-tv"> Time Lords can identify familiars time periods by a sense
								<span class="A-fanon">akin to</span> smell. This might be one of the "special powers" their noses have.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">Crystallization of local History: </span>
							<span class="A-tv">They can detect fixed points in time
								<span class="A-alternate">(crystallized events) </span>in any given time zone and have an aversion to interacting with such known events. </span>
							<span class="A-notbbc">They can see (though not identify) other people's time traces allowing them to know if sentient beings have been in
								the area. </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">A Time Lord who finds himself beyond the Noosphere will experience a powerful sense of unease.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook"> </span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Sense of Antiquity: </span>
							<span class="A-tv">They can sense an object's relative age by tasting it. </span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">TARDIS Recognition: </span>
							<span class="A-tv">They usually can identify a TARDIS, regardless of her disguise, and often tell the Type and general condition of the
								Capsule as well. </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">They get a slight tingling sensation in their fingers and toes when exposed to a fully energized TARDIS.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">Reading another's Biodata: </span>
							<span class="A-notbbc">They can perceive (in a vague way) the full history of the biodata of others.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">A mechanism inside Time Lord Biodata allows them to sense distortions in the biodata of others. In other words they
								can tell when someone's personal history has been altered. </span>
							<span class="A-tv">They will experience a strong sense of prejudice and revulsion if they detect someone who is immortal because they
								have become fixed in time and space. In some
								<span class="A-audiobook"> incarnations </span>this sense is so acute that they can </span>
							<span class="A-tv">read a person's</span>
							<span class="A-fanon"> biodata (such as</span>
							<span class="A-audiobook"> their future history) just by looking at them.</span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Losing one's virginity makes it much more difficult (if not impossible) for Gallifreyan technology to read ancestral

						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">Temporal Disturbance Sense: </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Time Fissures cause a tingling sensation. </span>
							<span class="A-tv">Some of these senses will make a Time Lord dizzy </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">and nauseous
								<span class="A-tv">when exposed to temporal disturbances.
									<span class="A-notbbc">When in a time loop, a Time Lord has a constant sense that something is 'about' to happen. </span>The effects of

									<span class="A-game"> (completely unnoticeable by lesser species)</span> can reduce
									<span class="A-game">Apprentice</span> Time Lords to tears.</span>
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">Paradox Sense: </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Proximity
to a temporal paradox causes them headaches. The technology of Faction
Paradoxes tends to induce mild allergic reactions, such as itching in
the temples. They are immune to Faction biodata viruses (except during
regeneration). Temporal distortion that causes the past, present, and
future to overlap makes a Time Lord’s scalp itch.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook"></span><span class="A-notbbc">A Time Lord can gaze into the Vortex and determine the health of the Web of Time. </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">They are programmed to panic if they think that there’s something wrong with the space-time continuum.&nbsp;</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-notbbc">History Proof: </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Time Lords
								<span class="A-notbbc">are "History Proofed" which</span> gives them superior abilities to remember alternate timelines (in most species
								they are little more then dreams) </span>
							<span class="A-notbbc">and can usually remember previous versions of history books (that they just read). Some Time Lords have deep-time
								memory, which allows them to clearly remember the original version of their history even after their personal past
								has been deliberately changed. </span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">Linearity Detection: </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Time Lords sense some violations to the Laws of Time
								<span class="A-fanon">(probably the Protocols of Linearity)</span> as shivers running up their spine.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="A-fanon">Chroniton Detection: </span>
							<span class="A-audiobook">Time Lords can sense Chronitons and Antichronitions. A sudden burst of them makes them feel like the local temporal
								field is being beaten about. </span>

				<span class="A-fanon">One of the reasons for this is that </span>
				<span class="A-game">Time Lord biodata actually changes and mutates the biodata of lesser species who interact with them. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Extensive exposure to a Time Lord
					<span class="A-game">can</span> cause a human to become 'infected' with Time Lord DNA,

bio-plasmic fields of chronon energy protect a Time Lord as they travel
from one time stream to another. The fields of a Time Lord will protect
their clothes (and the stuff in their pockets) from temporal shifts.
But this chronon energy also empowers a Time Lords regenerations. </span>

					Council) the opportunity to retire to somewhere in Normal Space.
					<span class="A-audiobook">This custom is millions of years old, but very few ever accept it. </span>They must give up their TARDIS as part of

				<span class="A-audiobook">Because </span>
